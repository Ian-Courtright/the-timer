# Timer Functionality Update

## Changes Made

- Verified the reset button functionality in the TimerControls component
- Replaced the Clock icon with a Plus icon for the custom timer button
- Implemented a custom timer input interface in the QuickTimer component
- Added input fields for hours, minutes, and seconds in the popup
- Created a "Start Timer" button that applies the custom time settings
- Ensured the reset functionality works by inspecting the onReset trigger in Timer.tsx

## Technical Implementation

- Used Popover component from the UI library for the custom timer input
- Created state variables to track hours, minutes, and seconds input values
- Implemented input validation for time fields (min/max values)
- Connected the "Start Timer" button to the onSetTimer callback
- Maintained the same styling patterns as the main application
- Verified that the reset button correctly triggers timer reset through the onReset counter mechanism

## Next Steps

- Consider adding preset time options along with the custom input
- Add validation to prevent starting a timer with all zeros
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common timer operations
- Add visual feedback when reset button is pressed
