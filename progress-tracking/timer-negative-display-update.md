# Timer Negative Display Update

## Changes Made

1. Updated the Timer component to display time in red with a negative sign when a countdown timer completes and starts counting up in "overage" mode
   - Added conditional CSS class to display the timer in red when in overage mode
   - Ensured minus symbol is displayed correctly before the time digits
   - Fixed minus symbol to pulse between red and white in sync with the timer digits

2. Enhanced the CircularTimer component to properly handle overage state
   - Improved the red pulsing animation for the indicator
   - Made the red pulse more noticeable with increased scale factor and higher opacity
   - Ensured the green count-up pulse is properly hidden when in overage mode

3. Fixed logic to properly distinguish between count-up and overage modes
   - Added checks based on initialTime to ensure overage is only set when a countdown completes
   - Updated mode handling in both Timer and Index components
   - Prevented false positives where regular count-up would incorrectly trigger overage mode

## Technical Implementation

### In Timer.tsx:
- Modified the time display element to dynamically apply text-red-500 class when in overage mode
- Added a minus symbol that appears only when in overage mode (countingUp && isOverage)
- Enhanced the timer logic to only set overage mode if we had a non-zero initialTime
- Added safety check to ensure timers that start from zero never enter overage mode
- Fixed minus symbol animation to pulse in sync with the timer digits by removing the fixed red color

### In CircularTimer.tsx:
- Enhanced the overage pulse animation to be more noticeable (increased scale and adjusted timing)
- Added explicit code to hide the green count-up pulse when in overage mode
- Ensured proper cleanup of animations when component unmounts or state changes

### In Index.tsx:
- Updated handlePlayPause to properly set states when starting countdown vs count-up timers
- Explicitly marked count-up timers as not being in overage mode

## Features Now Working Correctly

1. Countdown timer displays as white text when counting down
2. When countdown reaches zero, timer turns red with a negative sign (-00:00:01 format)
3. The negative sign pulses between red and white together with the timer digits
4. The indicator in the top left pulses red when in overage mode
5. Timer remains green when counting up without having started from a countdown
6. Clear distinction between regular count-up timers and countdown timers in overage mode

## Testing

- Verified correct display behavior in both countdown and count-up modes
- Confirmed the timer displays properly with the negative sign in overage mode
- Validated that the negative sign pulses in sync with the timer digits
- Validated that the top-left indicator properly pulses red in overage mode only after countdown
- Ensured green indicator works correctly when in regular count-up mode 
- Tested starting a timer from zero vs. starting a countdown timer to verify proper behavior in both scenarios
