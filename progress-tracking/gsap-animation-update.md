# GSAP Animation Integration

## Objectives
- Install GSAP animation library
- Add smooth animations to timer display
- Animate play/pause button
- Create transitions between timer states
- Match the aesthetic of the provided design

## Progress

- [x] Install GSAP
- [x] Implement animated timer display
- [x] Add animation to play/pause button
- [x] Animate the reset and settings buttons
- [x] Add smooth transitions between timer states
- [x] Fix animation reloading issues in header components
- [x] Fix reset functionality to always reset to 0:00:00
- [x] Update circular timer design to match screenshot
- [x] Convert circular timer to filled pie chart style
- [x] Update count-up mode to pulse red instead of showing pie chart
- [x] Sync pulse animation with 2-second timer cycle
- [x] Maximize timer display and enhance overall UI elements

## Technical Implementation
- Using GSAP for all animations
- Creating timeline-based animations for complex sequences
- Implementing responsive animations that work on all screen sizes
- Optimizing performance by using GSAP's best practices

## Completed Features
- Added smooth entrance animations for all UI components
- Created interactive animations for the play/pause button
- Implemented subtle background color transitions based on timer state
- Added visual feedback when the timer switches to counting up mode
- Enhanced header elements with subtle hover animations
- Added rotation animation to reset button
- Created smooth progress animations for circular timer
- Fixed animation reloading issues by tracking initial mount state
- Fixed reset button to properly reset timer to zero
- Redesigned circular timer with new styling to match screenshot
- Improved header layout and component positioning
- Enhanced QuickSets dropdown design and functionality
- Converted progress indicator to filled pie chart style for countdown
- Changed count-up mode to pulse red instead of showing pie chart progress
- Set red pulse animation to exactly 2 seconds to sync with timer ticks
- Maximized timer display size with super bold font for better visibility
- Increased size of circular timer for more prominent visual feedback

## Bug Fixes
- Prevented header components from reloading animations every second by:
  - Removing the HeaderWithTimerState callback function to prevent component recreation
  - Added React.memo to Header and CircularTimer components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Used useMemo for the background style to avoid unnecessary style recalculations
  - Replaced GSAP animations with direct style updates for progress changes
- Fixed animation overloading by implementing better cleanup and state tracking
- Modified reset functionality to ensure timer properly resets to 0:00:00
- Optimized animations to only run when necessary, improving performance
- Fixed circular timer to show as filled pie chart rather than outline
- Modified count-up mode to show pulsing red indicator per design requirements
- Adjusted timing of pulse animation to align perfectly with timer seconds

## UI Improvements
- Increased circular timer size (28% larger) and refined its design
- Changed circular timer from outline to filled pie chart style per design (for countdown)
- Made count-up timer pulse red rather than showing a pie chart
- Synced red pulse animation with the timer's 2-second cycle for visual harmony
- Simplified circular timer structure for more accurate representation
- Added small center circle for aesthetic touch while maintaining pie chart visibility
- Improved color scheme consistency throughout components
- Enhanced QuickSets dropdown with animation and better styling
- Refined header spacing and component alignment
- Added better hover states to interactive elements
- Dramatically increased timer font size to 14rem with extra bold weight
- Added stronger text shadow for better visibility and dramatic effect
- Adjusted layout spacing to accommodate larger elements
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with more prominent timer display
- Made red pulse animation more vivid with higher opacity (0.8) and scale (1.08)
- Reduced center dot size in circular timer to emphasize pie chart animation
- Improved overall UI proportions for better visual balance

## Next Steps
- Test animations on different devices and browsers
- Ensure accessibility is maintained with animations
- Add optional animation settings for users who prefer reduced motion
