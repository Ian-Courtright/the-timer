# Remove Timer Logs Cleared Notifications

## Problem

When clearing timer logs, multiple "Timer logs cleared" toast notifications were appearing on the screen. These popups were distracting and redundant to the user experience.

## Changes Made

1. Removed the toast notification when clearing timer logs:
   - Removed the `toast.success("Timer logs cleared")` line from the `handleClearLogs` function in `Index.tsx`
   - The logs are still cleared, but without showing the popup notification

## Technical Implementation

The main change was simple - removing a single line of code that created the toast notification:

```typescript
// Before:
const handleClearLogs = useCallback(() => {
  localStorage.removeItem('timerLogs');
  setTimerLogs([]);
  
  // If there's an active timer log, keep it but don't clear it
  if (!activeTimerLog) {
    // Reset test log creation flag to allow new test log creation after clearing
    localStorage.setItem('timerLogsInitialized', 'false');
  }
  
  toast.success("Timer logs cleared"); // This line was removed
}, [activeTimerLog]);

// After:
const handleClearLogs = useCallback(() => {
  localStorage.removeItem('timerLogs');
  setTimerLogs([]);
  
  // If there's an active timer log, keep it but don't clear it
  if (!activeTimerLog) {
    // Reset test log creation flag to allow new test log creation after clearing
    localStorage.setItem('timerLogsInitialized', 'false');
  }
  
  // No toast notification
}, [activeTimerLog]);
```

## Results

The timer logs are now cleared silently without showing any popup notifications. This creates a cleaner, less distracting user experience while still maintaining the same functionality.
