# Timer Events Tracking

## Overview
Added comprehensive event tracking to the timer logs. Every button click and state change in the timer is now recorded in a detailed timeline, providing a complete history of each timer session.

## Changes Made

1. Enhanced the TimerLog data structure:
   - Added a structured `events` array to track all timer events
   - Each event includes type, timestamp, and relevant time data
   - Supported event types: start, pause, resume, reset, add-time, complete

2. Implemented full event tracking:
   - Start: When a timer is first started
   - Pause: When a running timer is paused
   - Resume: When a paused timer is resumed
   - Reset: When a timer is canceled or reset
   - Add-time: When time is added to a running timer
   - Complete: When a countdown timer reaches zero

3. Added detailed event timeline display:
   - Color-coded event types for easier visual scanning
   - Shown in chronological order with timestamps
   - Displays the time value at each event
   - Special formatting for add-time events showing the amount added

4. Improved localStorage handling:
   - Proper serialization and deserialization of event data
   - Backward compatibility with older logs that don't have events
   - Test data generation with full event timeline

## Technical Implementation

### In types.ts:
```typescript
export interface TimerEvent {
  type: 'start' | 'pause' | 'resume' | 'reset' | 'add-time' | 'complete';
  timestamp: Date;
  timeData?: TimeData;
  duration?: number; // Only for add-time events
}

export interface TimerLog {
  // ... existing fields ...
  events: TimerEvent[]; // Array of all timer events
}
```

### In Index.tsx:
- Added event recording to all timer actions:
  ```typescript
  // When pausing
  setActiveTimerLog(prev => {
    if (!prev) return null;
    return {
      ...prev,
      pauseCount: (prev.pauseCount || 0) + 1,
      events: [
        ...(prev.events || []),
        {
          type: 'pause',
          timestamp: now,
          timeData: { ...currentTime }
        }
      ]
    };
  });
  ```

### In TimerSettings.tsx:
- Enhanced event timeline display:
  ```tsx
  {log.events && log.events.length > 0 && (
    <div className="col-span-2 mt-3 pt-3 border-t border-white/10">
      <p className="text-white/70 mb-2">Event Timeline:</p>
      <div className="space-y-2 text-xs">
        {log.events.map((event, index) => (
          <div key={index} className="flex items-start">
            <div className={`p-1 mr-2 rounded-full ${getEventBgColor(event.type)}`}>
              {getEventIcon(event.type)}
            </div>
            <div className="flex-1">
              <div className="flex justify-between">
                <span className="font-medium">{formatEventType(event.type)}</span>
                <span className="text-white/50">{formatEventTime(event)}</span>
              </div>
              <div className="text-white/50">{formatEventTimestamp(event)}</div>
              {event.type === 'add-time' && event.duration && (
                <div className="text-purple-300 mt-1">+{formatTime(event.duration)}</div>
              )}
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  )}
  ```

## Visual Enhancements
- Color-coded events for better visual scanning:
  - Start/Resume: Green
  - Pause: Blue
  - Reset: Yellow
  - Add-time: Purple
  - Complete: Dark Green

## Usage Benefits
- Detailed activity tracking for productivity analysis
- Better understanding of timer usage patterns
- Insight into how much time was spent on tasks vs. pauses
- Clear visualization of when additional time was added

## Future Enhancements
- Export event timeline to CSV for external analysis
- Aggregate statistics across multiple timer sessions
- Filter timer logs by specific event types
