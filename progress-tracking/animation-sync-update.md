# Animation Synchronization Update

## Changes Made

1. Synchronized the timer pulse animations
   - Made the red pulse in the top left corner sync with the timer pulse (matched to 1 second duration)
   - Kept the red-only pulsing for the overage indicator

2. Added smooth transition animations
   - Added animation for when a countdown time is first set (pie chart loads in)
   - Added intro animation for count-up mode (green pulse fades in)
   - Added transition animation when switching from countdown to overage mode (red pulse fades in)

3. Enhanced animation state tracking
   - Added state tracking to detect transitions between different timer modes
   - Implemented proper state cleanup to avoid animation conflicts

## Technical Implementation

### In CircularTimer.tsx:
- Added state tracking for previous values to detect transitions:
  ```typescript
  const [prevProgress, setPrevProgress] = useState(progress);
  const [prevIsCountingUp, setPrevIsCountingUp] = useState(isCountingUp);
  const [prevIsOverage, setPrevIsOverage] = useState(isOverage);
  ```

- Added special animation when a time is first set (pie chart reveal):
  ```typescript
  gsap.fromTo(pieRef.current,
    { backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(transparent 0deg, transparent 360deg, #ffffff 360deg, #ffffff 360deg)` },
    { backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(transparent 0deg, transparent ${targetDegrees}deg, #ffffff ${targetDegrees}deg, #ffffff 360deg)`,
      duration: 0.6,
      ease: "power2.out"
    }
  );
  ```

- Added emphasis animations for mode transitions:
  ```typescript
  gsap.fromTo(elementRef.current,
    { opacity: 0, scale: 0.5 },
    { opacity: 0.9, scale: 1.12, duration: 0.4, ease: "back.out(1.7)" }
  );
  ```

- Synchronized the red pulse duration with the timer's pulse:
  ```typescript
  duration: 1, // Match the timer's 1-second pulse
  ```

## Visual Improvements

1. Pie chart now animates in when a time is first set before starting the timer
2. Green pulse for count-up mode has a smooth fade-in animation
3. Red pulse for overage mode has a smooth transition when a countdown timer completes
4. The red pulse in overage mode is precisely synchronized with the timer's 1-second pulse
5. All transitions between modes have proper animation emphasis

## Testing

- Verified smooth transitions between different timer modes
- Confirmed the red pulse in the top left is synced with the timer pulse in overage mode
- Tested the pie chart animation when setting a time before pressing start
- Validated transitions from countdown to overage and from zero to count-up mode
