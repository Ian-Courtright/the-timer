# Timer Event Tracking Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the timer logs feature to include detailed event tracking for all user interactions with the timer. Each timer now has a comprehensive history of events including starts, pauses, resumes, time additions, timer completions, and resets.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Event Timeline to Timer Logs**
   - Each timer log now shows a chronological history of all events
   - Events are visually distinguished with unique colors and icons
   - The exact time of each event is recorded and displayed
   - Added support for multiple event types: start, pause, resume, reset, add-time, and complete

2. **Improved Event Data Storage**
   - Enhanced the TimerLog interface to include an events array
   - Each event stores its type, timestamp, current time data, and additional information
   - For time additions, the amount of added time is recorded and displayed
   - All events are saved to localStorage and restored when the app is loaded

3. **Added Backward Compatibility**
   - Added handling for older timer logs without the events array
   - Improved JSON parsing to handle date conversion for event timestamps
   - Added default values for missing fields to prevent errors

4. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Added color-coded event icons for better visual distinction
   - Events are presented in a clear timeline format
   - For add-time events, the amount of time added is highlighted
   - The current timer state at each event is recorded

## Technical Details

### Event Structure
Each event includes:
- **type**: The type of event (start, pause, resume, reset, add-time, complete)
- **timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **timeData**: The timer's time values at the moment of the event
- **duration**: For add-time events, the amount of time added in seconds

### Event Tracking Logic
- When a timer starts, a 'start' event is created
- When paused, a 'pause' event is recorded with the current timer state
- When resumed, a 'resume' event is logged
- When time is added, an 'add-time' event records both the timer state and the amount added
- When a timer completes, a 'complete' event is recorded
- When reset, a 'reset' event is stored

### User Interface
- Events are displayed in a clean timeline format below the timer summary
- Each event type has a unique icon and color for easy identification
- Time information shows the timer state at each event point
- For time additions, the exact amount added is highlighted

## Next Steps

1. **Export/Import Functionality**
   - Add ability to export timer logs with full event history
   - Enable importing logs from previous exports

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Analyze patterns in timer usage based on event data
   - Calculate statistics on pause frequency, average completion times, etc.

3. **Visual Improvements**
   - Add visual timelines or graphs to represent the timer's progress over time
   - Use event data to create visualizations of user behavior
