# Timer Events Storage Optimization

## Overview
Fixed critical storage issues causing "FILE_ERROR_NO_SPACE" errors by optimizing localStorage usage and preventing duplicate event entries in timer logs.

## Issue Identification
1. The application was encountering a localStorage space error:
   ```
   Uncaught (in promise) Error: IO error: .../135587.ldb: FILE_ERROR_NO_SPACE (ChromeMethodBFE: 3::WritableFileAppend::8)
   ```

2. A significant number of duplicate events were appearing in the timer history, particularly multiple "Completed" events with the same timestamp.

3. Excessive logging was causing unnecessary re-renders and localStorage updates.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Optimized localStorage Usage
- Added throttling to localStorage writes (once per second instead of on every state change)
- Limited the stored logs to the 20 most recent entries
- Added error handling and recovery for localStorage failures
- Implemented a fallback mechanism to clear localStorage and save only the most recent log if space issues persist

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      const logsToSave = timerLogs.slice(-20); // Keep only the most recent 20 logs
      localStorage.setItem('timerLogs', JSON.stringify(logsToSave));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to save timer logs:', error);
      try {
        localStorage.clear();
        const recentLog = timerLogs.length > 0 ? [timerLogs[timerLogs.length - 1]] : [];
        localStorage.setItem('timerLogs', JSON.stringify(recentLog));
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Could not recover localStorage:', e);
      }
    }
  }, 1000); // Throttle to once per second
  
  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [timerLogs]);
```

### 2. Prevented Duplicate Events
- Added checks to prevent adding duplicate events of the same type in succession
- Fixed the event handling for timer completion to ensure only one completion event is recorded
- Improved typing for TimerEvent handling with proper type assertions

```typescript
// Check if the last event is already of this type to prevent duplicates
const hasExistingEventOfSameType = activeTimerLog.events && 
  activeTimerLog.events.length > 0 && 
  activeTimerLog.events[activeTimerLog.events.length - 1].type === eventType;

// Create new event only if needed
const newEvent = !hasExistingEventOfSameType ? [{
  type: eventType as 'reset' | 'complete',
  timestamp: now,
  timeData: { ...currentTime }
}] : [];
```

### 3. Reduced Debug Logging
- Removed excessive console logging statements throughout the application
- Commented out debug logging in the TimerSettings component that was running on every render
- Removed unnecessary logging of timer logs in the localStorage save effect

## Results
- Eliminated the localStorage space errors
- Fixed the duplicate event entries in the timer logs
- Improved performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders
- Enhanced app reliability with proper error handling for storage operations

The timer history now displays correctly with a clean timeline of events and properly maintains state between sessions without experiencing storage failures.
