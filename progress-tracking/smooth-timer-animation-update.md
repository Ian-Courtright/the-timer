# Smooth Timer Animation Update

## Changes Made

1. Completely redesigned the pie chart countdown animation
   - Changed from a stepwise per-second animation to a smooth continuous animation
   - Added duration calculation that estimates the full timer duration
   - Made the pie chart smoothly animate from full to empty in one continuous motion

2. Enhanced timer state transitions
   - Added proper handling of all possible state transitions
   - Implemented state tracking for running vs. stopped states
   - Created smooth transitions between countdown, count-up, and overage modes
   - Added proper cleanup for all animations

3. Fixed animation lifecycle management
   - Added reference tracking for active animations
   - Properly pause/resume animations when timer starts/stops
   - Implemented proper killing of animations during state changes
   - Added cleanup for animations when component unmounts

## Technical Implementation

### In CircularTimer.tsx:
- Added state tracking for running state:
  ```typescript
  const [prevIsRunning, setPrevIsRunning] = useState(isRunning);
  ```

- Added animation reference tracking:
  ```typescript
  const pieAnimationRef = useRef<gsap.core.Tween | null>(null); 
  ```

- Implemented continuous pie chart animation:
  ```typescript
  // Calculate expected total duration based on progress percentage
  const expectedDuration = progress / 100 * (progress >= 5 ? 60 : 10);
  
  // Create one smooth animation from start to finish
  pieAnimationRef.current = gsap.fromTo(pieRef.current,
    { backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(transparent 0deg, transparent ${startDegrees}deg, #ffffff ${startDegrees}deg, #ffffff 360deg)` },
    { backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(transparent 0deg, transparent 0deg, #ffffff 0deg, #ffffff 360deg)`,
      duration: expectedDuration,
      ease: "linear"
    }
  );
  ```

- Added proper animation state management:
  ```typescript
  // Detect transitions
  const isStarting = isRunning && !prevIsRunning;
  const isStopping = !isRunning && prevIsRunning;
  
  // Handle transitions appropriately
  if (isStarting) {
    // Start new animation
  } else if (isStopping) {
    // Pause running animation
    if (pieAnimationRef.current) {
      pieAnimationRef.current.pause();
    }
  }
  ```

- Implemented proper animation cleanup:
  ```typescript
  // Clean up animations when component unmounts
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      if (pieAnimationRef.current) {
        pieAnimationRef.current.kill();
      }
    };
  }, []);
  ```

## Visual Improvements

1. Pie chart now smoothly animates from full to empty in one continuous motion
2. No more jerky updates or reloads during countdown
3. Smooth transitions between different timer modes (countdown → count-up → overage)
4. Proper pausing/resuming of animations when timer is stopped/started
5. Proper initialization animation when a time is first set

## Testing

- Verified smooth continuous pie chart animation during countdown
- Confirmed proper transitions between all timer states
- Tested pause/resume functionality when stopping/starting the timer
- Validated cleanup of animations during state changes and unmount
- Ensured no performance issues from animation management
