# Smooth Pie Chart Animation Update

## Problem

The pie chart visual countdown animation was not smoothly decreasing as time counted down. Instead, it was ticking like a clock with noticeable steps between each second.

## Changes Made

1. Improved the animation logic for continuous smooth transitions:
   - Modified the circular timer to use `fromTo` GSAP animations for smoother transitions
   - Set proper animation duration based on remaining time percentage
   - Implemented threshold-based animation updates to prevent jitter

2. Enhanced animation management:
   - Added proper handling for animation pausing and resuming when the timer is stopped/started
   - Improved progress tracking with the `lastProgress` ref to only update animation when changes are significant
   - Changed the progress change threshold from 5% to 2% for more frequent but still efficient updates

3. Fixed animation smoothness:
   - Ensured proper calculation of current pie chart angles based on progress
   - Used cleaner GSAP animation techniques to create one continuous motion
   - Properly synchronized animation duration with expected timer duration

## Technical Implementation

The key implementation changes were in the `CircularTimer.tsx` component:

1. Added proper animation resuming when a paused timer is restarted:
```typescript
else if (isRunning && pieRef.current && !isCountingUp && !isOverage) {
  // Already running - ensure animation is also running
  if (pieAnimationRef.current && pieAnimationRef.current.paused()) {
    pieAnimationRef.current.resume();
  }
}
```

2. Improved the progress update animation with smoother transitions:
```typescript
// Only restart animation if the progress has changed significantly
if (Math.abs(progress - lastProgress.current) > 2) {
  // Kill existing animation if there is one
  if (pieAnimationRef.current) {
    pieAnimationRef.current.kill();
  }
  
  // Save current progress for next comparison
  lastProgress.current = progress;
  
  // Get the current state of the pie chart
  const currentDegrees = 360 * ((100 - progress) / 100);
  
  // Calculate the remaining time based on progress
  const remainingPercentage = progress / 100;
  const expectedDuration = remainingPercentage * (progress >= 5 ? 60 : 10);
  
  // Create a new animation from the current state to empty
  pieAnimationRef.current = gsap.fromTo(pieRef.current,
    { 
      backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(transparent 0deg, transparent ${currentDegrees}deg, #ffffff ${currentDegrees}deg, #ffffff 360deg)` 
    },
    {
      backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(transparent 0deg, transparent 0deg, #ffffff 0deg, #ffffff 360deg)`,
      duration: expectedDuration,
      ease: "linear"
    }
  );
}
```

## Results

The pie chart now animates smoothly as a continuous motion rather than in discrete ticks. The animation properly represents the countdown timing and provides a much more visually pleasing experience.
